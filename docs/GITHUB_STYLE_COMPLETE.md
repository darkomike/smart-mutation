## ✅ GitHub-Style Mutation Testing Reports - Complete!

I have successfully transformed your Smart Mutation Tool to generate **GitHub-style HTML reports** with code diff views, making it look and feel like GitHub's pull request interface!

### 🎯 **Key Enhancements Implemented**

#### **1. GitHub-Inspired Visual Design**
- **Authentic GitHub colors**: `#f6f8fa` background, `#24292f` text, `#d0d7de` borders
- **GitHub typography**: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI'` font stack
- **Card-based layout**: Clean, modern cards with subtle shadows and borders
- **Responsive design**: Adapts beautifully to different screen sizes

#### **2. Code Diff Visualization (Like GitHub PRs)**
- **Line-by-line diffs**: Shows exactly what mutations were applied to your code
- **GitHub diff colors**:
  - 🔴 **Red background** (`#ffebe9`) for original code lines
  - 🟢 **Green background** (`#e6ffed`) for mutated code lines  
  - ⚪ **White background** for context lines
- **Line numbers**: Proper line numbering for easy navigation
- **Monospace code**: Uses `SFMono-Regular, Consolas` for proper code display

#### **3. Status Badges (GitHub-Style)**
- ✅ **Detected mutations**: Green badges (`#d4f4dd` background, `#1a7f37` text)
- ❌ **Missed mutations**: Red badges (`#ffeef0` background, `#cf222e` text)

#### **4. Professional Report Structure**
- **Header section**: Project overview with key statistics
- **Recommendations**: GitHub warning-style suggestions for improvement
- **Mutation cards**: Individual cards for each mutation with expandable diffs
- **Execution metadata**: Timing and file information for each mutation

### 🔍 **Code Change Visualization Example**

Your mutations now show up like this:
```
15    return a + b;     // Context line
16  - return a + b;     // Original code (red)
16  + return a - b;     // Mutated code (green)  
17    }                 // Context line
```

### 🚀 **Usage & Results**

**Same simple command:**
```bash
dart run bin/smart_mutation.dart --config your_config.json
```

**New output:**
```
📊 GitHub-style HTML report saved to: your_output_dir/mutation_test_report.html
```

### 📊 **Report Generated Successfully**

Your HTML report now includes:
- **Summary statistics** in a clean grid layout
- **Individual mutation cards** with diff views showing exactly what changed
- **Status indicators** showing which mutations were detected vs missed
- **Smart recommendations** for improving test coverage
- **Professional GitHub-style appearance**

### 🌟 **Benefits**

- **Familiar interface**: Developers instantly recognize the GitHub-style layout
- **Better debugging**: See exactly which code changes broke (or didn't break) tests
- **Professional sharing**: Reports look polished enough to share with stakeholders
- **Visual clarity**: Much easier to understand than JSON reports
- **Code context**: See mutations in proper context with surrounding code

The tool has been successfully enhanced to provide a GitHub-like experience that makes mutation testing results as easy to read as a pull request diff! 🎉
